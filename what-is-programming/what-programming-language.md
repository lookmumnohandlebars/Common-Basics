# What Programming Language Should I Learn?

There's definitely a great deal of opinion on this. Most of it is wrong - most of what is written below is wrong. People approach with their own biases based on how they learned, what they use now, what software they built and broke in the past.

Generally, you can't go wrong with most commonly used languages.

To paraphrase Scott Hansleman:

> The best programming language is any programming language. People get hung up on the details of a language, they need to be thinking of the systems that a language lives within. Pick a programming language, see if it feeds your spirit, see if it doesn't. You can be successful in any language.

### ü•Ö Choose Based On Your Goal

There's no point diving into javascript if you want to build software for machinery. Similaryly there's little point diving into C if you want to be a web developer.

My suggestion: Pick a job, or a few jobs, that you are aiming for.

If you are in a job and aiming to get better (i.e. product manager learning coding), pick something that you can use at your workplace (or that your workplace uses).

### ¬©Ô∏è Languages are (mostly) the same

Whatever language you choose, most are built off of the same underlying principles, with tweaks to syntax (how they look & read) and how the operate under the hood.

You will be able to get started in most areas in any language - data science is not limited to python.

What you will buy into, however, is a philosophy of how that language works, which is something to be aware of as the elements of programming held in highest regard change from language to language.

### üó∫Ô∏è A rough guide to language suitability

While most programming languages are suitable for most things these days, certain usages or patterns tend to make one favourable to another for certain applications or companies.

There is also the concept of high-level and low-level languages, where low-level languages deal more with computer resource management in your code, such as memory management. Generally I would recommend a high-level language for a starter, and learn a low-level language once you can make things in a high-level language.

<u>Starter languages</u>:

- **C# (AKA .Net)**: Enterprise-grade back-end web development, high-level game development (Unity). A little slower to develop but generally encourages quality.
- **Typescript (& JavaScript and NodeJS)**: Front-End web development, all-round useful language for Start-ups as you can code pretty much everythin in one language. Quick development, difficult to create large systems with, but more popular than before due to current patterns.
- **Python**: Back-end web development, Data Science & mathematics, (some) hardware programming capabilities for use in production. For me, its dynamic typing and indented scoping make it a liability, for others that makes it a blessing. Good for quick things, difficult for large things.
- **Go (aka Golang)**: Making fast applications, generally all-round useful language, but with some limitations that prevent it being great. Slightly lower-level than most other starter languages.
- **Ruby**: Used a lot by startups for web applications due to operating a little like C# (allows good architecture), and versatile thanks to large open source community, but with some severe drawbacks & enough unique syntax that makes it difficult to transfer to other languages.

> Note: If you are wanting to match my materials, I would start with either C# and/or TypeScript

‚ö†Ô∏è Languages I wouldn't go near (yet):

- **R**: R is mostly used for Data Science & scientific applications almost exclusively. However it has a reputation of being beginner friendly and useable by scientists - so if science is your thing maybe start with R.
- **C**: Programming machines and computers - the likelyhood is you won't have to touch this in your early career, unless you plan to do, or have done, computer science at university.
- **C++**: High performance programs & advanced-level game design, but reasonably low-level and difficult to get moving quickly with
- **Rust**: Rust is a great language, but is not used a huge amount (yet) professionally and is low-level, one to learn as a hobby language at the moment
- **Java**: Java is also an enterprise-grade language along the lines of C#, but has not aged particularly well so really in use if you plan to work for older company that uses it as part of its legacy software.
- Functional Langauges (e.g. **F#**, **Haskell**): These languages, while fun, are tricky and introduce a difficult coding paradigm that is hard to get out of. Use these for fun.
- Lesser used languages (e.g. **Scala**): Unless you are going for a specific job, these limit your chances in that first job.
- Bespoke languages (e.g. **Elm**): you won't be able to learn what you need to for all other programming languages.

- Pick your starter <s>pokemon</s> language! Use the guidance given, if you are unsure pick 2. If you really don't know, start with TypeScript (or JavaScript) as this will serve you best for general development skills
